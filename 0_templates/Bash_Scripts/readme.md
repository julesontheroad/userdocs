
# Bash Script updater template.

Bash script updater.

This bash script update/updater templates deals with updating a single file, the `~/bin/somescript`, by updating and switching to this script.

There are two implementations of this template. `update.sh` and `menu.sh`. They are identical except for:

`update.sh` is designed to be linear script, a to b.

`menu.sh` is designed to be an interactive looping menu until the use exits.

**1:** A `wget` command is used to download the github hosted script somewhere on your server.

**2:** When run without bypassing the built in updater the script will compare itself against the github version and update in place if needed.

**3:** The script will then move and rename itself to the `~/bin` directory using then name define in the `$scriptname` variable and be executable. So for example `~/bin/install.somecript`

So how do I use and customise this updater template with my script?

Basic Info section:
---

**1:** Optional - fill in the basic info section at the start for those reading the script code.

**2:** Most of the important information and usage directions are meant to be set in the script info section and used with the script option info. So set them there if required.

Version History Section:
---

**3:** Modify the version history templates in the Version History section and uncomment on a per line basis to use with the script option `changelog`, for example, `somescript changelog`

Variables Section:
---

**4:** `scriptversion="0.0.0"` - replace `0.0.0` with your script version. This will be shown to the user at the current version check.

**5:** `scriptname="somescript"` - replace `somescript` with your script name. Make it unique to this script. Do not include the file extension.

**6:** `scriptauthor="None credited"` - change this to the script author's name.

**7:** `contributors="None credited"` - add the names of any contributors you wish to credit here.

**8:** `gitiourl="http://git.io/vvf9K"` - change this to the shortened URL provided by [http://git.io](http://git.io) once you have committed the script to github or from a gist.

**9:** `gitiocommand="wget -qO ~/$scriptname $gitiourl && bash ~/$scriptname"` - Leave this as it is. Do not modify it. This variable depends on the correct setting of the `$gitiourl` variable.

**10:**` scripturl="https://raw.github.com/feralhosting"` - Set the scripturl variable in the variable section to the RAW github URL of the script for use with the updater features.

**11:** `appport="$(shuf -i 10001-32001 -n 1)"` - works in tandem with a while loop just below it. Will generate and test a port to make sure it is not in use. Use this when configuring an application's port.

**12:** `updaterenabled="1"` - Set this to `0` to permanently disable the built in updater and associated features.
